/**
 * Fluent builder for a shell command execution.
 *
 * Desktop-only. On mobile platforms the call is a no-op and an error
 * result is emitted with `exitCode = -1` and a "not supported" stderr
 * so listener code can still handle it uniformly.
 *
 * Captured results arrive via the `nb:shell-result` Livewire event with
 * four arguments: `$stdout`, `$stderr`, `$exitCode` and `$id`.
 *
 * Example:
 * ```php
 * NativeBlade::shell(function (Shell $s) {
 *     $s->id('docker_check')->run('docker ps');
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * When `spawn()` is called the command runs as a long-lived, streamed
 * process instead: output arrives line by line on `nb:shell-data`
 * (`$chunk`, `$stream`, `$id`), completion on `nb:shell-exit`
 * (`$exitCode`, `$id`), and the process can be fed stdin
 * (`NativeBlade::shellWrite`) and terminated (`NativeBlade::shellKill`).
 *
 * When `openTerminal()` is called, the command is spawned in the OS
 * terminal (Windows Terminal / cmd / PowerShell on Windows, Terminal.app
 * on macOS, gnome-terminal/xterm on Linux) instead of being captured.
 * In that mode no `nb:shell-result` event is emitted — the command runs
 * visibly in a terminal window the user can interact with.
 *
 * @see \NativeBlade\NativeResponse::shell()
